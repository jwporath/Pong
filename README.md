# v1 Features
Once opened, the game will automatically pause and display the controls. The player controls the paddle on the left side of the screen and the game will control the right paddle. The player moves their paddle up and down using the up and down arrow keys. Use the escape key to pause and unpause the game at any time. To close the game, you may use the close button on the window itself or press 'Q' at any time. The game has an option called "DRBC Mode". When enabled, DRBC Mode will make the player's paddle cover nearly the entire goal. Lastly, the game does not have a maximum score and will continue until the player closes the window or quits the game.
